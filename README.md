# ðŸ§  Learn Machine Learning Concpets Practice & Exercises
 
This repository contains **exercises and mini-projects** covering the core concepts of Machine Learning.  
Itâ€™s perfect for anyone who wants to **learn by doing** and build confidence in ML step by step.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside
Weâ€™ve got exercises for **each major ML concept**, including:

- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Handling missing values  
  - Normalization & standardization  
  - Encoding categorical variables  

- **Supervised Learning**
  - Linear Regression  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Decision Trees & Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)  
  - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

- **Model Evaluation**
  - Train/Test Split  
  - Cross-Validation  
  - Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. **Pick a concept** you want to practice (e.g., KNN).  
2. Open the exercise file and try to solve the problem step by step.  
3. Run the code and experiment with different parameters.  
4. Build a **mini-project** using what you just learned.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This is Useful
- âœ… Practice each concept **individually** so you truly understand it.  
- âœ… Gradually move from simple exercises to **real-world mini-projects**.  
- âœ… Boost your portfolio with clean, working ML projects.
